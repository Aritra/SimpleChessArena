# SimpleChessArena
A minimalist python program to hold a tournament between student chess engines
For holding a competition give the group files to the student groupes. Tell them just to change the filename and not the class. Then in the arena, change the imports to the proper group name and run... its that simple
Note: The return of the makemove function in the engine has to be in UCI format.
feel free to ammend more complexities as needed but I kept it as simple as possible for beginers to understand.

This was made as a part of AI assignment at BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus. 
The arena shows the game with 1 sec pause between moves, just comment out the rendering portions if you do not want to visualize the game
imports neccessary:
pip install python-chess
pip install cairosvg
pip install matplotlib

Go ahead and enjoy
